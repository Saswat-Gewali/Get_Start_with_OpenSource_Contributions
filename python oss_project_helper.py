"""
Open Source Project Markdown Helper

This script is a simple, single-file utility designed to help maintainers 
and first-time contributors quickly generate standard project files in Markdown
format (README, CONTRIBUTING guide, etc.).

It is highly useful for beginners as it shows the expected structure of a
well-maintained open-source repository.

Usage:
    python oss_project_helper.py
    (The script will prompt the user for input and generate the files.)
